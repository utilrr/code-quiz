## Challenge 4


This weekâ€™s Challenge: Build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## Aims of this project

1. Create a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores.

2. The quiz timer begins when the start button is clicked and the user is presented with the first question.

3. When the user answers a question the user is presented with the next question.

4. If the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.

5. The game is over when all questions are answered or when the timer reaches 0.

6. Users can enter their name alongside their score in the Top 10 list, if they are one of the 10 best.
