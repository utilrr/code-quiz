## Challenge 4


this weekâ€™s Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

1. GIVEN I am taking a code quiz WHEN I click the start button THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

2. WHEN I answer a question THEN I am presented with another question

3. WHEN I answer a question incorrectly THEN time is subtracted from the clock

4. WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 THEN the game is over

5. WHEN the game is over THEN I can save my initials and score
